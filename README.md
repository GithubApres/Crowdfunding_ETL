# Crowdfunding_ETL

# Mini Project 2 , this is submitted to help us with building an ETL pipeline 
# There was transformation of data with Python , Pandas and Python dictionary methods
# I worked on this on my own , but did not successfully upload the CSV files into a Postgres database 
# However I was able to create 4 CSV files and created an ERD and a table schema .
